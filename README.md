# SAP S/4HANA Labs – ERP Process & Cost Flow Analysis

Hands-on SAP S/4HANA lab exercises using the **Global Bike (GBI)** dataset.  
This repository documents end-to-end ERP business processes and how data flows across key modules such as **SD, MM, PP, FI, and CO**.

**Goal:** Demonstrate practical understanding of ERP workflows, process integration, and cost flow concepts through SAP S/4HANA labs.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository covers:

- End-to-end ERP process execution in SAP S/4HANA
- Business document flow (Order → Delivery → Billing → Accounting)
- Procurement and inventory movement lifecycle
- Production planning fundamentals (BOM, routing, production orders)
- Controlling and cost flow concepts
- Integrated process flow across multiple modules

## 🧩 Lab Summaries

All lab documents are available in the [`labsummary/`](./labsummary) folder.

| Lab | Topic | Modules | Key Learning Outcome |
|-----|------|---------|----------------------|
| Lab 1 | Order-to-Cash (O2C) | SD → FI | Executed the sales lifecycle from sales order to billing and payment |
| Lab 2 | Materials Management | MM | Practiced the procurement lifecycle (PO → Goods Receipt → Inventory updates) |
| Lab 3 | Production Planning | PP | Worked with BOM/routing and production order execution flow |
| Lab 4 | Controlling | CO | Explored cost elements and basic cost flow/controlling concepts |
| Lab 5 | Integrated Process | SD + MM + FI + CO | Validated end-to-end integration and data flow across modules |

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- SAP S/4HANA (Lab environment)
- Global Bike (GBI) dataset
- ERP modules: SD, MM, PP, FI, CO

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- ERP is a process-driven integrated system, not just a collection of transactions
- Document flow and cross-module integration (e.g., SD → FI, MM → Inventory) became clearer through hands-on execution
- Improved understanding of how operational activities connect to accounting and cost tracking
